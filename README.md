# neotrix.vim
ðŸ’šA  nice dark colorscheme for Vim and NeovimðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ§ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ«â¬›â¬œ

This colorscheme is totally not finish and I recommend using the gui of vim or nvim or add the following to your `init.vim` or `.vimrc`:
 ```vim
  syntax on
  colorscheme neotrix
  set termguicolors
  ```
## Instalation
1. Install the theme using your favorite vim plug in manager or manually place it in `colors/neotrix.vim` directory in  `~/.vim/colors`.

## Contributing

I'm new to vim so I hope you can help me.
